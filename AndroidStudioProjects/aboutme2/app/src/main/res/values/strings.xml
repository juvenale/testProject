    <string name="nationalAntem">O Cameroon, Thou Cradle of our Fathers,
\nHoly Shrine where in our midst they now repose,
\nTheir tears and blood and sweat thy soil did water,
\nOn thy hills and valleys once their tillage rose.
\nDear Fatherland, thy worth no tongue can tell!
\nHow can we ever pay thy due?
\nThy welfare we will win in toil and love and peace,
\nWill be to thy name ever true!

\n\nLand of Promise, land of Glory!
\nThou, of life and joy, our only store!
\nThine be honour, thine devotion,
\nAnd deep endearment, for evermore.

\n\nFrom Shari, from where the Mungo meanders
\nFrom along the banks of lowly Boumba Stream,
\nMuster thy sons in union close around thee,
\nMighty as the Buea Mountain be their team;
\nInstil in them the love of gentle ways,
\nRegret for errors of the past;
\nFoster, for Mother Africa, a loyalty
\nThat true shall remain to the last.

\n\nLand of Promise, land of Glory!
\nThou, of life and joy, our only store!
\nThine be honour, thine devotion,
\nAnd deep endearment, for evermore.</string>
